Credit Card Fraud Detection

Description:
This project leverages machine learning to predict credit card transaction fraud. It employs a Python-based backend, a user-friendly Streamlit interface, and a FastAPI-powered RESTful API.

Key Features:
Robust Model: Trains a sophisticated machine learning model on historical transaction data.
Intuitive Interface: Offers a Streamlit dashboard for easy data visualization and testing.
Flexible API: Exposes a RESTful API for seamless integration with other applications.

Technologies:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
FastAPI

System distribution:
1. Application is made using streamlit to make a user interface consist of main page where user predictions are made by input and upload of file. And past prediction is displayed in next page.
2. Backend service is interacted using fastAPI script using python service. It makes to predict and store the predicted data.
3. Data are stored in Postgres SQL.
4. Airflow is used for data ingestion pipeline.
